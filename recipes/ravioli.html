  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Homemade ravioli are so delicious and fun to make! In this post we demonstrate making ravioli with a ravioli stamp tool. However, this recipe can be used to make ravioli using several different methods. Check out our complete How To Make Ravioli tutorial for five different ways to make ravioli (including the easy wonton wrapper method).</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 to 5-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sauce:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1-1/2 cups tomato puree</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
    <li>1/3 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh basil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsly</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 carton (15 ounces) ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded part-skin mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh basil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minces fresh parsly</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place 5 cups flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center. Beat the eggs, water and oil; pour into well. Stir together, forming a ball. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 4-6 minutes, adding remaining flour if necessary to keep dough from sticking. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>

      <li>Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, combine sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>

      <li>In a large bowl, combine filling ingredients. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

      <li>Divide pasta dough into fourths; roll 1 portion to 1/16-in. thickness. (Keep pasta covered until ready to use.) Working quickly, place rounded teaspoons of filling 1 in. apart over half of pasta sheet. Fold sheet over; press down to seal. Cut into squares with a pastry wheel. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>

      <li>Bring a soup kettle of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; cook until ravioli float to the top and are tender, 1-2 minutes. Drain. Spoon sauce over ravioli.</li>
