  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It makes a homemade pizza crust like you get from your favourite wood fired Italian pizza place. Puffy edges that
      are slightly crispy on the outside, but chewy and moist like Artisan bread on the inside.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 cups all purpose (or 00 flour) + some for dusting</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>2.23 cups COLD water</li>
    <li>1 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Favorite Toppings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Caramelized onions</li>
    <li>Arrabiata Sauce</li>
    <li>Heirloom Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    <li>Green Onions</li>
    <li>Smoked Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    <li>Sauteed Mushrooms</li>
    <li>Ricotta Meatballs</li>
    <li>Roasted Peppers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven as high as it will go for at least 45 minutes to one hour with the pizza stone already inside.
      (I baked at 525"F but check your pizza stone for max temperature).</li>

    <li>In the bowl of your kitchen aid and using the paddle attachment mix the flour, sea salt and active dry yeast
      (<--amazon) on low speed until all is incorporated then add the COLD water. 5 cups all purpose (or 00 flour ),1.5
        tsp active dry yeast,1.5 tsp sea salt,2.25 cups COLD water</li>

    <li>Switch to the dough hook and mix together on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and
      sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom.</li>

    <li>NOTE - If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more
      water. This will vary every time you make it so keep extra flour handy.</li>

    <li>After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the mixer and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into
      rounds. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs or so of extra virgin olive oil. Cover
      with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area, I prefer the
      cold oven. ( At this stage you can also freeze the dough individually or place in the fridge overnight or a couple
      of days).
      1 tbs extra virgin olive oil</li>

    <li>Sprinkle the counter with a little bit of flour, take one piece of dough and press down on it with your fingers
      until you have 1/2" thick circle or oval. Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough until 10" in
      diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie).</li>

    <li>Dust your pizza peel (or a piece of cardboard) very well with semolina flour or corn meal and set your pizza
      dough on it making sure it slides easily when moved. Pour 2-3 tablespoons of the pizza sauce in the center and
      spread it around with the back of a spoon leaving 1 inch of space at the edges and making sure not to get any on
      the peel. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and add your favorite toppings. ( Don't add too many toppings, keep in mind
      this is a thin crust and a couple of toppings will suffice ).
      Arrabiata Sauce</li>

    <li>Gently slide the pie on the preheated pizza stone in a hot 525"F degree or more oven, and bake for 5 to 7
      minutes or until golden brown on the edges. When making the breakfast pizza I find that the egg cooks perfectly in
      6 minutes.</li>

    <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the basil and freshly grated parmigiano reggianno. Allow to rest for a
      few minute for the cheese to set.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>By Hand Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast, salt and cold water and using a wooden spoon mix to combine
      well.</li>

    <li>Sprinkle some flour on a work surface/kitchen counter and dump the pizza dough. Sprinkle some more flour on top
      and using your hand knead the dough for about 10 to 15 minutes until a smooth ball forms but still a little bit
      sticky on the bottom. Follow the steps above afterwards.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure to preheat your oven with the pizza stone in it for at least 45 minutes, and finish cooking the pizza
      under the broiler for a nice charred touch.</li>

    <li>If topping with heirloom tomato slices, make sure to use the firm ones, otherwise the pizza would be watery.
      Thin firm slices is what you want.</li>
  </ul>
